#Lab 6A Vignesh Peddi
#PROMPT: Write a Python program that reads the data from the file and stores all data into appropriate lists. The program should then prompt the user for the personâ€™s last name they are searching for and display all available information on that person if they are found.  
#VARIABLE DICTIONARY
#records               counts the records in the file
#binary_code           counts how many times the binary search performs the loop 
#lname                 LIST stores the last names of everyone in the file
#fname                 LIST stores the first name of everyone in the file
#dob                   LIST stores the dob of everyone in the list
#loop                  controls the loop to continuouslly run the program
#min                   min value of binary search(index)
#max                   max value of binary search(index)
#guess                 guess for the search determines next max/min
#search                what user is searching for
