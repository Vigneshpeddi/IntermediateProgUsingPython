#Lab 7 Vignesh Peddi
#Prompt: Depending on how the user wants to search, you may need to sort the searched-through list before performing Binary Search.  Binary Search should be used for Menu Options 1 (First Name) and 2 (ID codes)  and the full record for the individual searched should be included if found (the user should be alerted if the person cannot be found).  If the user chooses options 3 or 4, you must print a list of everyone and their full record that fits the searched item (think: sequential search!) that has that Last Name or Allegiance.  Use the GOT_bubble_sort_7.txt file (you may change the name if you wish but you may NOT edit the text file outside of checking for and deleting empty end records).  The user should be able to search as many times as they would like.  If the user enters an option that does not exist, the program must tell them this before asking if the user would like to search for a new record
